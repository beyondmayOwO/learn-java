// Interface is an "easier/convenient/alternative" version for the abstract class
// Subclass can only have one superclass but multiple interfaces
// Study by comparing interface and the abstract class

// The methods that share across multiple classes

// The big advantage of interface is polymorphism. See in Main.java
// Classes that implement interface must 'implements' the interface method
